# Examples of devOP in software 

1. planning phase
2. build
3. test
4. operate
5. monitor
6. plan

# What can we learn from Devops for MLOps
1. create models / procedures that give reprodicible reults. + source control.  
2.  Model versioning and storage
3. model packaging and validation 
   eg, container deployment
4. Model deployment
5. continious retraining 

# Naive ML models vs professional ones
1. Models move from "fixed" static datasets to evolving ones
2. data will be validated before feeding into model
